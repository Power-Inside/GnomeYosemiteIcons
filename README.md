Yosemite Icons
==================

A Linux icon theme to match Yosemite

Meticulously hand-crafted in Inkscape :)

Make sure to download and install the [Numix Circle](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme-circle "Numix Circle Repository") icon pack first, because there aren't many icons in this pack currently, and the icons in Numix Circle aren't as jarring as having a default gnome icon staring you in the face.  Ugh.

If you don't see an icon in amazing Yosemite style, just start an issue and I should take care of it quickly.


Not Working
=============

I couldn't get teamviewer to work, you may have better luck though.
Plank is annoying in regards to wine programs.
